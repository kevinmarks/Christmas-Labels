A python app to generate christmas mailing labels from Google Contacts CSV files.
Uses pdfgen from reportlab to make a PDF.

DONE:
Add a UI
Made it work on AppEngine http://xmaslabels.appspot.com
Add a UI that makes sense for both modes
work with downloaded contacts
Refactor so label layout definition is in a struct not globals/defaults
Overhaul web UX so someone other than me can use it.
Add links to help email address

TODO:
CSS style it so it's shiny.
Cope with other kinds of paper (eg A4, landscape US)
Support vcard files too
Hook up to PoCo via OAuth
store label layouts and make them editable
